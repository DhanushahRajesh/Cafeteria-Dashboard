#Cafeteria-Dashboard
##Project Objective
The objective of this project is to design an interactive Power BI dashboard that provides a comprehensive view of Brew & Biteâ€™s sales performance. The dashboard aims to track key business metrics such as total revenue, order volume, top-selling products, and customer ordering patterns across weekdays and time slots. By visualizing this data, the goal is to uncover actionable insights that support better decision-making around menu optimization, promotional strategies, and operational efficiency.
